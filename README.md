# HeyListen!

**HeyListen!** is a discord bot that assists with Discord's integrated Spotify sharing. It allows the
users of a Discord channel limited control of the current Spotify sharer's playback, including adding
tracks to the current queue and skipping the playing tack. **HeyListen!** comes with a simple permissions
system that allows the sharer to tune how the channel can interact with playback.
